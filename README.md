A monolith implementation of a recruiting platform, focused on developers.

Mainly used to demonstrate some best practices regarding Django app structure and testing 
with Pytest fixtures. The src code is also used to facilitate a short py.test tutorial

Quickstart
----------

The database assumes you will be using postgres. Please ensure that your postgres user 
can create and drop DB's or has postgres superuser rights

```
$ createuser -s -P recruitme  # add ` -U postgres` if you are not a postgres superuser  
$ createdb recruitme
# Make a venv: this could be a different process/path on your workstation
$ mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/local/bin/python3 recruitme
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py sitetree_resync_apps
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
$ python manage.py runserver
```

Running tests:
```
$ py.test # or execute py.test from any sub folder in unit_tests/
$ pt.test -n auto
$ py.test --coverage
$ py.test PATH 
```
