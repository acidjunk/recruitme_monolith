    <h2>Motiviation</h2>

    <p>Recruit Me Now was started to get my inbox clean. When I added python developer to my LinkedIn profile I started
        getting all kinds of connect requests from recruiters. Some type of offers are interesting but most of them
        aren't.
        As I don't connect with people I don't know the process of connecting to respond on the bogus connect requests,
        and then remove the connection again, was rather time consuming.</p>

    <p>Most offers are job related; but I have my own company and therefore i'm only interested in freelance offers.
        There also are a lot of request that don't pay enough or are not interesting for geographical reasons. So I
        decided to build a social recruitment platform where a developer can put his c.v. and other profile info. When a
        recruiter is interested he/she can send a p.m. which triggers an e-mail with just 2 options: share/not share
        c.v.</p>
