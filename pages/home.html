                <p>Most developers are annoyed when recruiters claim to have the next best job offer that just doesn't make sense.
                   The new job/project could be on a wrong location or they misinterpreted Python in your c.v. into Java.
                   As a lot of recruiters also just try to connect on LinkedIn without adding any info on the new job/project this leads to a total waste of time on both sides.</p>

                <p>We help you to filter incoming request from recruiters by letting them register on the site.
                   They have to fill out a form before they can access you personal details and experience. You can decide to share your full c.v. or decline the request.</p>

                <h3 class="ui header">We Help Recruiters</h3>
                    <p>Recruiting developers that have a profile on RecruitMeNow is easy. With just a link to a profile you will get a availability date.
                       Login with linkedIn and answer the questions and in most cases you will get a high quality and updated c.v.</p>
